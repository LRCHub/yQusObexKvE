Stirring at water's edge
Cold froth on my twig
My mind in whirls
Wanders around desire

May i, can i or have i too often
Craving miracles
May i, can i or have i too often now
Craving miracles
Craving miracles

No one imagines the light shock i need
And i'll never know
From who's hands deeply humble
Dangerous gifts as such to mine come

May i, should i or have i too often
Craving miracles
May i, can i or have i too often
Craving miracles
Craving miracles

My romantic gene is dominant
And it hungers for union
Universal intimacy
All embracing

May i, should i or have i too often
Craved miracles
May i, can i or have i too often
Craved miracles
Crave

Waves irregularly striking
Wind stern in my face
Thunderstorm come
Scrape those barnacles of me!

May i, may i or should i too often
Crave miracles
May i or should i or have i too often

All my body parts are one
As lightning hits my spine
Sparkling
Prime runs through me
Revive my wish
Inviolable

May i, can i or have i too often
Craving miracles
May i, can i, should i or have i too often
Craving miracles
