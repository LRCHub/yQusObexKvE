Hell breaks loose
We're in the noose
The heavens are going to crumble
It's hell on earth
Fear the worst
Think you're safe? Beware
It's our fate, it desecrates
With its lethal force
Ripped and torn
Hell is born
It's your worst nightmare

Better leave, can deceive
Need to heed the warning
Forget your wealth, save yourself
There's metal in the air

It's a Hellfire Thunderbolt
It's a Hellfire Thunderbolt

Terrify, will destroy
No chance to ride the storm out
Planets crash feel the wrath
The stratosphere's on fire
Better leave, can deceive
Need to heed the warning
Forget your wealth, save yourself
There's metal in the air

It's a Hellfire Thunderbolt
It's a Hellfire Thunderbolt

These comets of death were hurled from the sky
They came here from light years away
Like never before, we know what's in store
It's a penance we must pay

It's a Hellfire Thunderbolt
It's a Hellfire Thunderbolt
It's a Hellfire Thunderbolt
It's a Hellfire Thunderbolt

Hellfire
