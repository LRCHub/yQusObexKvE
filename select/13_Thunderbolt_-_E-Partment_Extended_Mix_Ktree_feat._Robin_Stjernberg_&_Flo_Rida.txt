Baby, I turned my eyes on you
I feel the love rush through as I lie awake
I've never longing for anyone
I wish so many times I long for you

In a way, in a way we have it all
In a way, in a way, it's nothing to rob

You hit me like a flash from the other side
You take me through the night like a thunderbolt, thunderbolt
You hit me like a flash from the other side
You take me through the night like a thunderbolt, thunderbolt
Thunderbolt

Baby, you make me feel like myself
When the dust disappear, you took me from this hell
I've never (I've never) longing for anyone
Oh, no, so many times I long for you (for you)

In a way, in a way we have it all
In a way, in a way, it's nothing to rob

You hit me like a flash from the other side
You take me through the night like a thunderbolt, thunderbolt
You hit me like a flash from the other side
You take me through the night like a thunderbolt, thunderbolt

Thunderbolt, thunderbolt

You hit me like a flash from the other side
You take me through the night like a thunderbolt
